# Gradient-Boosting-Using-Hyperopt
Gradient boosting has been widely used in machine learning. This ensemble method enhances trees to learn from the current error.
Here i used Hyperopt for hyperparameter tuning as i found it is very effective and time saving, hyperopt as one of library in Python uses Bayesian Optimization which considers results from the past to learn. 
Since the data that i got from UCI Repository this time suffers severe imbalanced class, therefor i executed SMOTE-NC too to handle this issue. 
Finally the model produced could be used to predict new potential customer in telemarketing with high accuracy and AUC. 
^^ ENJOY THE JOURNEY ! ^^
